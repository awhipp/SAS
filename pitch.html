             <h4> The hook: </h4>
             <u>How many of employees here have:</u>
              <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Entered an elevator. You know no one. It becomes an awkward silence.
              <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Enter your hoteling space. You say hello. The next 8 hours neither of you say another word.
              <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) You scheduled a meeting with someone a week in advance, only to have that appointment fall through and have a new one rescheduled
              <br>
              <br>
             

             Now take, A 2011 study of 13,000 consultants showed that 73 percent of entry level/analysts, 66 percent of consultant/recent MBAs, 55 percent of senior/experienced consultants and 46 percent of director/managers intended to leave their firm. Booz Allen Hamilton is no exception to this. These lower tiers represent a bulk of the work force and result in a huge financial burden on the firm.

             <br>The combination of these two factors leads to the problem. A firm should not only promote professional development, but also social development. Especially in a market that there is no fixed work place. We are social creatures and if we do not feel we belong--a basis in Maslow's heirarchy of needs, then we will not feel connected in a firm which promotes networking so strongly.

          <br>

            <h4>The problem:</h4> 
            This problem arises because of a position that requires flexible work locations and schedules, as well as cyclical period of indeterminant amount of work. These two factors do not appeal to an individual who decides they want to settle down and lead to low employee engagement. While we cannot entirely change the job, we can change the social structure of the firm by using basic psychological principles to increase the employee's engagement.

          <br>

            <h4>The solution:</h4>
            Enterprise gamification. The first time I heard of the term, I found it laughable, but at a psychological level it is sound and logical. At it's roots this concept takes an everyday activity and applies methods of gaming or competition to it. When we this concept with the ability to network with colleagues around you... it results in my product. In discussions with the design thinking lab and collaborating with others around the firm, I have designed an app as a service which promotes dynamic networking within the firm through enterprise gamification. It addresses all the issues I mentioned in my introduction and promotes employee engagement through a systematic focus on their connection to the firm which they work at. 

          <br>
            <h4>Whatâ€™s next:</h4>
            Given the option to proceed I will be able to explain this application further, it can not only be applied to our firm and reduce turnover rates as well as increase employee engagement. But, the model can be applied to our management consulting arm and be integrated into contracts relating to, but not limited to, change management and other issues we address on a daily basis.
