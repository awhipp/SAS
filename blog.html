			<p>So, we last left off with me working a contract for a start up just outside of D.C. About 4 months later, I have completed the terms of my contract, and we have submitted my Google Glass application to Google for approval. That feedback just came to me, and I will begin revisions, and hopefully have my first Glassware application on the market around next semester! In other news, I have started as a web & mobile developer at an education based start up known as MyQVO. I will be assisting them in developing their mobile brand to help kids, who are struggling in school, archieve their goals. Hope everyone had a good Thanksgiving. I am super thankful for my career, and also for the ability to have my profession work so easily in a remote fashion. It allows for my education and work coexist so well. <br><br> Onward to completion of my last fall semester!</p>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">September 04, 2014</p>
			<p>So right now I am sitting on the plane returning from Arizona after a 5-day vacation from it all. Now what do I mean by "it all?" Well, this summer I decided to take a break from the normal "go to the beach and enjoy life" mentality. I buckled down and decided to take a 3-credit course in business management (for my recently added minor), and work 40-hour weeks in DC as a intern consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton. No big deal. The primary focus of my project was to integrate emerging technologies such as Google Glass, Oculus Rift, and cloud computing into a portable system for military use. All of this project, because of all of its developmental platforms, was used as a proof of concept to be later leveraged by anticipated contracts. It's honestly been a good summer, and only proved to me that anything can happen. Now off to get moved in to the University of Maryland and begin work at the Department of Justice. More to come...</p>

<p>Today I set off to build on yesterday's code. Should this post be shown it represents the ability to now add images to my site's blog without having to physically type the code in HTML or modify CSS. The image shown above represents my current travel. I am visiting and touring Arizona from Maryland with my uncle who lives down here on a ranch.</p>

			<p>Hey there, I am currently in the works of making this website my professional face. With that I figured it would be a good idea to also have a blog which shows that I do have a life outside of academics and bothering recruiters (like probably the one reading this post right now). Anyway, the purpose of this post is mostly to see if my post uploader actually in fact works. If you are seeing this then it did, and if not well... this is awkward. Thanks for reading.</p>
