<h4>Interesting Turn of Events</h4>
<p>So to say this semester has been different would be quite an understatement. Thankfully I have learned the magic that is Google Calendar, and it has resulted in my ability to stay on my feet with this busy schedule. Between my 18-credits, my organizations, and work I am definitely pulling a 40 hour week, and it feels like the summer never ended. The good news is that I have stayed ahead of the curve and have yet to procrastinate on any assignments. My goal is to have all projects/papers complete two days in advance, and so far, even if it is the third week, I am succeeding. It feels great. On a professional note, I decided to turn down the position at the Department of Justice. Due to recent job offers for graduation, I did not feel I needed to stress myself with an unpaid position to boost my resume. After deciding this, I applied to numerous positions, and acquired an independent contract to create a glassware application for Curiosity Media—so this is what I am currently working on. This software provides e-learning capabilities for English-to-Spanish comprehension. Hopefully it will be the first publishable piece of software that I can say I created on a play store. Only time will tell… Back to coding, the career fair, and much much more… <br><i><font size="-2">Posted: 2014/09/14 23:29:47</font></i></p>

<h4>My Summer in a Nutshell</h4>
<p>So right now I am sitting on the plane returning from Arizona after a 5-day vacation from it all. Now what do I mean by "it all?" Well, this summer I decided to take a break from the normal "go to the beach and enjoy life" mentality. I buckled down and decided to take a 3-credit course in business management (for my recently added minor), and work 40-hour weeks in DC as a intern consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton. No big deal. The primary focus of my project was to integrate emerging technologies such as Google Glass, Oculus Rift, and cloud computing into a portable system for military use. All of this project, because of all of its developmental platforms, was used as a proof of concept to be later leveraged by anticipated contracts. It's honestly been a good summer, and only proved to me that anything can happen. Now off to get moved in to the University of Maryland and begin work at the Department of Justice. More to come...<br><i><font size="-2">Posted: 2014/08/14 12:36:54</font></i></p>

<h4>An Image is worth 1000 Words</h4>
<center><img src="img/arizonaflight.png" alt="arizonaflight.png" border="5"></center>
<p>Today I set off to build on yesterday's code. Should this post be shown it represents the ability to now add images to my site's blog without having to physically type the code in HTML or modify CSS. The image shown above represents my current travel. I am visiting and touring Arizona from Maryland with my uncle who lives down here on a ranch.<br><i><font size="-2">Posted: 2014/08/11 08:07:09</font></i></p>

<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>Hey there, I am currently in the works of making this website my professional face. With that I figured it would be a good idea to also have a blog which shows that I do have a life outside of academics and bothering recruiters (like probably the one reading this post right now). Anyway, the purpose of this post is mostly to see if my post uploader actually in fact works. If you are seeing this then it did, and if not well... this is awkward. Thanks for reading.<br><i><font size="-2">Posted: 2014/08/10 21:54:00</font></i></p>
